  comments: ISO DIR 2, 25.3 "Numbering and subdivision” states:"Within a given clause

    element:
  type: ed
  comments: In item 2-20.21, the “narccosz” string is very hard to read due to the
    lack of spacing. “n” here on first glance looks like part of the function name
    “arccos”. In Clause 4, it says "Binary operators, for example +, −, /, shall be
    preceded and followed by thin spaces”. However, for functions, it says “… there
    shall be a thin space between the symbol for the function and the argument”, without
    a thin space preceding the function.
  proposed_change: Perhaps an additional guidance should be given that a thin space
    needs to precede a function name. For example, if I have a constant called “a”,
    which is rendered in straight type, and it is placed before “sin x” to indicate
    multiplication of “a” with “sin x", it would look exactly like “asin x”; but “a
    sin x” with a preceding space before the function name alleviates the issue.

  comments: In 2-20.26 and 2-20.27, there is a conspicuous difference in the rendering

    in remarks of 2-20.27), and horizontal form (also first line in remarks of 2-20.27).
    This is very confusing to the reader. The document would benefit from using a
    consistent fraction style throughout the document, and by also providing guidance
    on when these 3 different fraction presentation styles can apply. The document
    today contains an intermix of them, seemingly without particular reason.

    styles apply.

  comments: The practice of “cos(x) + y” vs “cos x + y” is not typically a source
    of confusion because of operator precedence. This is similar to the example of
    "5 x + 6” where rarely anyone will consider “5 (x + 6)” being an option. A better
    example would certainly help. Instead, the component highlighted below in 2-20.17
    might work better as an example of confusion.
  proposed_change: Replace the example of “cos x + y” with something that actually
    looks ambiguous, like the “sin” expression in Item 2-20.17.

  comments: The ISO 80000 and IEC 80000 series should denote exact Unicode points
    for all symbology used, especially for the math symbology used in ISO 80000-2.
    In Unicode, there are many symbols in the math plane that can apply but provide
    different semantics. It can be very confusing and frustrating when the user cannot
    easily discover how to reproduce the notations given in the standard.Other standards
    that utilize Unicode, such as those from ISO/TC 46/WG 3 (“Transliteration”) like
    ISO 233 (Arabic transliteration), provide exact code points for every character
    to avoid confusion.For example, in ISO 80000-2, it is clear that the character
    of a matrix “bold italics A” (item 2-16.1) uses a different font from the natural
    number set “bold sans-serif N” (item 2-7.1), but there is no described semantic
    difference. In Unicode, the former character is part of the "Mathematical Bold
    Italic Capital“ series (U+1D468) but the latter is part of the "Mathematical Sans-Serif
    Bold Capital” series (U+1D5E1). If I use both symbols in a document, and change
    the font to a sans-serif font, the “A” will be in the same presentation style
    as the “N”, which is not what ISO 80000-2 intends.
  proposed_change: The ISO 80000 and IEC 80000 series should denote exact Unicode
    points for all symbology used, especially for the math symbology used in ISO 80000-2.

  comments: In items 2-12.26, 2-12.27, 2-20.5, 2-20.6, the finite integral symbol
    (the “⨍”) is incorrectly encoded. The “Finite Part Integral” symbol has code point
    "U+2A0D” in Unicode. However, in ISO 80000-2, the finite integral symbol does
    not use this correct character. This particular character in ISO 80000-2 is actually
    re-created by composing two symbols overlapping each other by using “Character
    spacing":When “Character spacing” is set to 0, this is what happens:Notice that
    it is actually 2 symbols. The dash is actually "shifted" backwards to place on
    top of the integral symbol. In some cases, the integral symbol is shifted backwards
    instead to place it at the dash.This is not an intended use of Unicode characters
    and should be avoided in ISO 80000-2, because:1. A reader who copies the finite
    integral symbol is actually copying a sequence of 2 symbols, namely "∫-"2. The
    reader who uses the correct Unicode finite integral symbol “⨍” will never be able
    to match the presentation given in ISO 80000-2, because it was a custom, manually-created
    symbol that is not reusable and interoperable.The relevant items that use this
    symbol are provided below for reference.
  proposed_change: Use the finite integral symbol as provided by Unicode.

    First of all, remarks should not contain any definition for functions. Moreover,
    items 2-14.8, 2-14.9 … define inverse functions as separate items. It would make
    sense for the "complementary functions” in 20-20.7 and 20-20.9 to be also defined
    as individual items.
  proposed_change: Define the "complementary functions” in 20-20.7 and 20-20.9 as
    individual items.

  comments: Clause 4, paragraph 8, contains a permission that specifies the comma
    as the preferred separator between numbers or expressions. However, notice that
    in Clause 4, paragraph 6, it is already extremely confusing to see “… the function
    and the argument, e.g. int 2,4; sin…”. In the case where a sentence already uses
    the “comma” for sentence separation, not only that the embedded list of numbers
    or expression shall not use the “comma” for list separation, but for the avoidance
    of confusion, parentheses should not be omitted in functions if it contains a
    "decimal comma”.For example, “… the function and the argument, e.g. int(2,4);
    sin…” is much less confusing.It seems that the considerations around list separators
    when using a “decimal comma” need to be better explained, specifically on how
    the usage of the “decimal comma” affects the defined items in ISO 80000-2. In
    ISO 80000-2, most of items use the “comma” to separate numbers/expressions.The
    permission in Clause 4, paragraph 8 should further state that a consistent practice
    should be applicable “context/document-wide” — the consideration is not only for
    particular formulas inside a context/document, because it is important that a
    reader can follow a consistent mathematical presentation practice throughout a
    context/document. It could be simple as for a document to state its symbology
    practice, if it uses the decimal comma for numbers, it will use the semicolon
    for number separation.In Clause 4, paragraph 8, it says that a “semicolon” can
    be used as an alternative separator. However, in ISO 80000-2, there are functions
    that utilize the “semicolon” symbol for argument separation. Items 2-20.13 and
    2-20.14 define specific meanings for what semicolons mean. This means that numbers
    with decimal commas cannot utilize the “semicolon” symbol as a list separator
    in these two items. Yet there are no alternatives provided in the document.Items
    2-6.14 and 2-6.15 suggest that an additional alternative for separation two numbers
    in an ordered pair/tuple can be the “stroke” symbol. This becomes “(a | b)” and
    “(a1 | a2 | a3 | …)”.However, the “stroke” symbol is commonly used for stating
    propositions (item 2-6.4), and when used consecutively it can be mistook for cardinality.e.g.
    “(a1 | a2 | a3 )” can be interpreted as "(a1 card(a2) a3)” or “(a1, a2, a3)”.Or
    we could follow the remarks in item 2-6.4 and reassign the “stroke” symbol for
    propositions to only use the “colon”. However, the “colon” sign is also commonly
    used for mapping (item 2-12.5 to 2-12.8).There is clearly more consideration that
    needs to be fully thought through in the mathematical presentation practice stated
    in ISO 80000-2 regarding the application of the decimal comma. ISO 80000-2 should
    provide a consistent set of symbology for audiences using a decimal comma but
    there are a number of gaps today in this area.
  proposed_change: Reconsider fully the mathematical presentation practices stated
    in ISO 80000-2 regarding the application of the decimal comma and provide refined,
    accurate and actionable guidance.
